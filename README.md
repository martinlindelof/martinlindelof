Hello, robot.txt crawlers and fellow nerds.

I like Blender 3D and 3D creation. I love-hate coding.

Of all the languages I've tried, Rust made me realize how much
I love and think C/C++ makes the most sense.

If you have a C++ job opening, maybe with Qt framework. e-mail me.

Also a gamer, and wants to make my own game. Working on a proto-type.
If you're a 1) Swede 2) Smart 3) Likes gaming 4) Knows C++ 
and thinks rewriting a vulkan renderer for Godot is a good idea, let me know.

It's either Godot = Small code base, good project structure, good enough
to bring in assets and making UI. Just would need to extend the source code (mostly C/C++)
and with a in-house renderer it would be sweet.

My github repos are mostly old stuff.
